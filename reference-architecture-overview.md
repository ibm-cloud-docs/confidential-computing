# Reference architecture overview
{: #reference-architecture-overview}

The reference architecture overview provides the supported architectures that can be used as a basis for implementing confidential computing solutions. Learn about these reference architectures in the following table.

| Reference architecture   | Description    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Secure Containerized Workloads  | Whether you are building a cloud native application, or on an application modernization journey, you can now do both with peace of mind by leveraging IBM’s Secure Execution technology.  Containerizing applications within a Confidential Computing environment ensures that your applications are protected, even the IBM admin doesn’t have access, and workloads are isolated by a secure boundary to prevent privilege user escalation. |
| Digital Assets Infrastructure | IBM Digital Asset Infrastructure provides the building blocks to create end-to-end solutions for storing and transferring large quantities of digital assets in highly secure wallets. Cstomers can utilize Secure Build to further enhance their security posture. This technology validates code before it is deployed to a container, ensuring that only verified code is allowed to run, ultimately reducing malware threats, and misconfigurations.  |
| Secure Multi Party Computation (MPC) | As various entities collaborate towards a common goal the need for the individual data privacy as well as intellectual property protection remains. While MPC leverages cryptography a key aspect of this model is the protection from each other. With Confidential Computing it is possible to enable distributed MPC, where participants are ensured their data or insights are protect even when being calculated outside their direct control.
