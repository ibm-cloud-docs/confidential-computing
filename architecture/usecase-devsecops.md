How to leverage confidential computing to secure the development and build pipeline.


Whether you are building a cloud native application, or on an application modernization journey, you can now do both with peace of mind by leveraging IBM’s Secure Execution technology.  Containerizing applications within a Confidential Computing environment ensures that your applications are protected, even the IBM admin doesn’t have access, and workloads are isolated by a secure boundary to prevent privilege user escalation.
