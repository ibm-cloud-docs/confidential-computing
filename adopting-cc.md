# Implementing confidential computing solutions
{: #implement-cc}

{: shortdesc}

When adopting a confidential computing solution based on the Confidential Services Platform, it is crucial to consider data sovereignty compliance, ensure hybrid cloud readiness, and utilize secure execution technology. 
{: shortdesc}

Your solution must integrate with a zero trust architecture and leverage a trusted execution environment for containerized applications. Understanding of confidential computing concepts among the team is essential, as is familiarity with cryptographic operations and attestation processes. Additionally, understanding the specifics of your deployment, whether cloud-based or on-premises, is important for successful implementation. 

When complexities arise or when there is a need for expert guidance on best practices, architecture decisions, or security considerations, contact your local sales representative or send an email to [zaas.client.acceleration@ibm.com](mailto:zaas.client.acceleration@ibm.com){: external} for more help, especially when you have to involve intricate regulatory compliance, sophisticated deployment scenarios, or advanced technology integrations that require a deeper level of expertise.
