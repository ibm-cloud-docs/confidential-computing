## Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC
{: #hpvs-cloud}

Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC leverage the IBM Secure Execution for Linux technology to provide the latest confidential computing as-a-service solution on IBM Cloud. It is a fully managed confidential computing container runtime that enables you to deploy containerized workloads in isolated tamper-proof computing environments, thus mitigating your security concerns about moving mission-critical workloads to public clouds. For more information, see [Confidential computing with LinuxONE](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-se){: external}.

You can now also deploy a workload built with SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images into the Hyper Protect Container Runtime in a hybrid confidential computing environment. For more information, see [Confidential Computing with SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images Using the IBM Hyper Protect Platform](https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_ibm-hpvs){: external}.

## Hyper Protect Virtual Servers
{: #hpvs-on-prem}

IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Servers leverage the IBM Secure Execution for Linux technology to protect Linux workloads on IBM Z and LinuxONE throughout the application lifecycle â€“ from build through to deploy and manage. You can be confident that applications and data are always private and protected from internal and external threats. For more information, see [IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Services documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hpvs/2.1.x){: external}.

## {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}
{: #hpcs}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} is a dedicated key management service and Hardware Security Module (HSM) that provides you with the Keep Your Own Key (KYOK) capability for cloud data encryption. Built on FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified hardware, {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} provides you with exclusive control of your encryption keys. You can take the ownership of the HSM through master key initialization. With {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}}, you can connect your service instance to keystores in IBM Cloud and third-party cloud providers, back up and manage keys using a unified system, and orchestrate keys across multiple clouds.

The following architecture diagram shows how you interact with Hyper Protect Crypto Services components to protect your sensitive data and keys.
