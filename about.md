# Getting started with Confidential Computing
{: #about}

Confidential computing (CC) protects applications and data while in use by keeping them encrypted all the time, even in memory, and only decrypting inside the processor, which is also known as Truested Execution Environment (TEE). The decryption keys are known only to the application/data owner and the processor. This way, even a compromised operating system or hypervisor can’t peek into the application or steal any sensitive data. Confidential computing is critical for cloud deployments, but also for edge deployments where such devices can be easily compromised or stolen. It’s also important for AI data processing where data needs to be shared (such as federated learning) but the data owners don’t trust the infrastructure where data needs to be jointly processed.

 IBM Cloud® goes beyond confidential computing by protecting data across the entire compute lifecycle. You gain a higher level of privacy assurance with complete authority over your data at rest, in transit and in use. Based confidenital computing on [IBM Secure Execution for Linux technololgy](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=virtualization-introducing-secure-execution-linux), you can securely deploy workloads in the cloud. This technology is part of the hardware of IBM z15 (z15) and IBM LinuxONE III generation systems. It ensures the integrity and confidentiality of boot images, and server authenticity. Applications are isolated from the operating system, thus providing more privacy and security for the workload.
